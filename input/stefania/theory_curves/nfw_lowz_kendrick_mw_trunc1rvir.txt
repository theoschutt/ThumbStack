# Here the NFW profile is the average of the NFW profiles
# for all the masses in the CMASS K sample.
# The 3d NFW profile was truncated at 1 Rvir, such that the total mass
# enclosed is Mvir.
# It was then projected to 2d, convolved with the non-Gaussian beam at 150 and 90 GHz,
# and propagated through the AP filters.
# If one were to simply compute the NFW profile for the mean mass in the sample,
# one would find a largely overestimated profile.
